        <h1>Discourse? What's that about?</h1>
        <p>8-bit Discourse was created with the intent of building a user-driven platform for gamers to have real discussions about games. And when I say real, I mean no trolls, no unseen price tags, no nonsense: it's purpose is for gamers to critically discuss and evaluate games in every aspect, in order to raise the medium's growing recognition as an art form.</p>
        <p>All of that being said, 8-bit Discourse is not a place for elitism or dick-waving(lol?). Games are supposed to be fun and, regardless of opinions, the expecation of these discussions is to share opinions and reflect on the experience of others, to provide a place where gamers can openly share critiques while building a community that fosters mutual respect and constructive conversations.</p>
